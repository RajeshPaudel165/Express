The views directory is typically used to store template files for rendering HTML pages. Since you haven't specified any particular view files, I will create a basic structure for a view file that could be used in an Express application. 

Here is the content for a sample view file named `index.ejs` that you might want to include in the `/express-app/express-app/views` directory:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Express App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to the Express App</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is a sample view for the Express application.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 Express App</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
